# Solving the Tube Challenge with Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning learning implemented in Python and using the `PyTorch` library.

## Aim
The aim is to demonstrate an understanding of concepts, methods and models in the area of Reinforcement Learning and how to use/apply them using software frameworks in Python. This should involve using knowledge acquired in the course and building on this knowledge through an independent study to go more deeply into a specific subject. The project may cover different aspects of _reinforcement learning_ methods, demonstrating an understanding of their suitability for a given class of problems, how to implement and validate them using synthetic and/or real datasets. The project can also comprise case studies involving specialised and/or complex scenarios in which you can experiment with different actions, states, rewards and policies. You may consider establishing some theoretical properties regarding RL methods or proposing your own methods.

## Remarks
This group project is submitted as part of assessed coursework.
